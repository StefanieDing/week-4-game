## Big Hero 6: RPG

Big Hero 6 themed RPG game. The user can choose their favorite character from the cast of Big Hero 6 and has to battle all the other characters to win the game. I added an option to play 'Battle Music' (Fall Out Boy - Immortals) whilst playing the game.

## Motivation

Created during Week 4 of Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to create a Star Wars RPG Game, but I added a twist with one of my favorite Disney films.
